# Sensors

This section contains examples of reading sensor data using Raspberry Pi GPIO pins. Each script demonstrates how to interface with a different type of sensor.

## Included Scripts
- **echoLocation.py** – Measures distance using an ultrasonic sensor (HC-SR04).
- **tiltTest.py** – Detects tilt motion using a tilt sensor.
- **sos.py** – Calculates the speed of sound in miles per hour (MPH) using timing data from an ultrasonic sensor (HC-SR04).
- **pir-motion.py** – Detects motion using a Passive Infrared (PIR) sensor and prints alerts in real time.

## Concepts Covered
- Reading digital input values
- Measuring distance with sound waves
- Sensor calibration and real-time data reading

## Hardware Needed
- HC-SR04 ultrasonic distance sensor
- Tilt switch sensor
- Breadboard and jumper wires
