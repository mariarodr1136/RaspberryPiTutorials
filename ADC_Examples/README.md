# ADC Examples

This section demonstrates how to use the **ADC0834** analog-to-digital converter with the Raspberry Pi. These scripts show how to read analog values from various sensors and control devices like servos and RGB LEDs.

## Included Scripts
- **anIn.py** – Reads analog values from the ADC0834.
- **joyStick.py** – Reads X/Y joystick input and button state using ADC0834.
- **potServo.py** – Uses a potentiometer to control a servo motor’s position.
- **RGBmix.py** – Mixes LED colors based on potentiometer input for each color channel.

## Concepts Covered
- Analog-to-digital conversion
- Reading multiple analog channels
- PWM-based control using analog input
- Integrating sensors and actuators

## Hardware Needed
- ADC0834 chip
- Potentiometers
- Joystick module
- Servo motor
- RGB LED
- Breadboard and jumper wires
